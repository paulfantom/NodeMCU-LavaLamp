Summary
-------

Lua based CoAP and HTTP server able to control one relay and take temperature 
readings from DS18B20 thermometer.


Installation
------------

Firstly flash ESP8266 with NodeMCU firmware from NodeMCU-firmware folder or 
compile your own with those modules:
    - node
    - file
    - gpio
    - net
    - wifi
    - tmr
    - uart
    - bit
    - ow
    - coap
For flashing instructions follow NodeMCU github.

Next upload to ESP8266 following files:
    - init.lua
    - binaries/lavalamp.lc
    - binaries/ds18b20.lc
    - NodeMCU-Configuration-Webpage/ap.lc
You can do it using ESPlorer tool.


Configuration
-------------

When first switching device ON it will go into Access Point mode in which it 
serves configuration web page (@ http://192.168.1.1)

After switching device ON it searches for previous network configuration 
and if one is found it should turn lamp relay ON and OFF for ~10 seconds in 2 
second intervals. If you switch device off in this 10s period it will delete 
all configuration files and reset itself to factory defaults.

AP mode is better explained in NodeMCU-Configuration-Webpage readme
